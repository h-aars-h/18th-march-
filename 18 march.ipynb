    "# Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "# Ans 1 : machine learning, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables) for\n",
    "# building a predictive model. One popular method for feature selection is the filter method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The filter method is a type of feature selection that works by selecting features based on some statistical measure of\n",
    "# their relevance to the target variable, independently of the machine learning algorithm being used. This means that the\n",
    "# filter method selects features before the model is trained and without taking into account the interactions between the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The filter method involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a scoring metric that measures the relevance of each feature to the target variable. Examples \n",
    "# of scoring metrics include correlation, mutual information, and chi-squared test.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute the score of each feature using the scoring metric.\n",

    "# Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "# Ans-\n",
    "#     The Wrapper method for feature selection differs from the Filter method in that it selects features based on their ability to improve \n",
    "# the performance of a specific machine learning model. Unlike the Filter method, which uses a statistical metric to rank features independently of\n",
    "# the model, the Wrapper method evaluates subsets of features by testing them with the actual model being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Wrapper method works by using a search algorithm to evaluate different subsets of features and testing each subset with the machine \n",
    "# learning model. The performance of the model is measured using a performance metric such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. The search\n",
    "# algorithm continues to evaluate different subsets of features until the optimal subset is found that maximizes the performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "# One common example of the Wrapper method is the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm, which starts with all the features and recursively\n",
    "# removes the least important features until the optimal subset is found. The RFE algorithm uses the actual model being used to make the feature\n",
    "# selection decisions and can improve the performance of the model by selecting the most informative subset of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compared to the Filter method, the Wrapper method can be more computationally expensive since it involves training and evaluating the model for\n",
    "# each subset of features. However, it can also be more accurate since it considers the interactions between features and the specific model being\n",
